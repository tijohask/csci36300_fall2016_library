In order to set up the shared library, open the terminal in the directory with the library array files and type "source shared_array_path". Once the session has been set up, simply type ./driver_exe to run the program.
If you should need to close and reopen the terminal, you will need to rerun the "source tutorial_path" command.
The shared object created by the command is called "libarray_lib.so"
